# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
This project is focused on Unsupervised Learning where we learn; Data Selection, Data Processing and Data Transformation from datasets that:
•	has are no paired inputs and outcomes.
•	The model uses a whole dataset as input.
Based on this knowledge, we will create an analysis for a client who is preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market by;
•	Transform the data to create an intuitive representation for analysis or to use in another machine learning model; or
•	Cluster or determine patterns in a grouping of data, rather than to predict a classification.
 
## Results:
The first Visualization is the Elbow Curve using K-means Algorithm, where we decide what is the best number of clusters to optimize the modeling of the data
We used PCA (Principal Component Analysis) Model to apply dimensionality reduction on the scaled dataset
Finally, we used Hvplot scatter plot since we use a non-continuous axes  
We can clearly see the all the cryptocurrencies are categorized into four groups.
